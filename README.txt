PONG
Written in Casanova - http://casanova.codeplex.com/
By Jack Jamieson, Sean Safari, and Glen Oakley

In order to run this sample game you need Visual Studio.  If you open up the solution and resolve the path issues(all folders/projects provided) the game should run fine and all content and code should be available.

- Content goes in Pong/Content/Content.
- CasanovaPrelude is a required project.
- Game code is in Pong/pong/Program.fs
- MenuUtils is not currently needed, it is for future developments.

GUIVersion is an experiment by Sean with the Casanova launcher - it is not required.
